# SBOM-sg-SEPIA
The team at Bosch were working on a mapping of SPDX and CycloneDX on both property level (= syntax) and a semantic interpretation of the information. They wrote a schema that describes a bare minimum SBOM on semantic level, and a validator for this. This repo is to explore the work done.
